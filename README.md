# 🧮 Calculator App: No Cap, Just Math.

## 📌 TL;DR

Basically, I built a calculator because doing mental math is not the move. It’s sleek, it’s fast, and it’s coded with zero "spaghetti" logic. Whether you're calculating a 20% tip or figuring out if you can afford that iced coffee, this app has your back.

## 🚀 Professional Overview (For the Recruiters)

This is a high-performance, responsive web application designed with a focus on clean code architecture, UI/UX best practices, and error handling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (ES6+)

Architecture: Modular component structure for scalability.

Design: Mobile-first, responsive interface with a focus on accessibility (A11y).

## 💎 Key Engineering Features

Input Validation: Prevents edge-case crashes (like dividing by zero—we don't do that here).

State Management: Efficiently handles complex arithmetic strings and memory functions.

Precision Logic: Implements floating-point correction to ensure 0.1 + 0.2 actually equals 0.3.

## ✨ Features (The Tea)

Dark Mode Support: Because staring at a bright screen at 3 AM is a red flag 🚩.

Responsive AF: Works on your desktop, your phone, and even that tablet you never use.

Smooth Transitions: The UI is buttery smooth—no glitches, just vibes.

History Log: In case you forgot what you just calculated (real ones know the struggle).

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calculator-app.git

Open the index: Just double-click index.html. No heavy dependencies, no npm install trauma.

Live Large: Start calculating and secure the bag 💰.
